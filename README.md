Implementation of Binary Search Tree, Doubly Linked List, and Linked List in Java for remembering how to implement them.

I plan to implement a new data structure where nodes at the same level of a binary search tree are connected like a doubly linked list. Additionally, I will build a new database system using that data structure.
